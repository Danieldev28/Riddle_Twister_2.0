bathroom item
combines two words
used for communication
you need it to survive
vampire
In the absence of light you have...
it sunk the titanic
no one knows...
a loss of words
oxygen,heat,fuel
the weight of a small car
only a little left
a fruit for roman kings
a hydrogen sulfide gas
a precious metal
they give us free oxygen
we would not survive more then week without it
you use it to point
something you make on your wedding day
more then eighty percent of the earth is covered in it
