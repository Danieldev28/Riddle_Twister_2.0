# Daniel Smith Portfolio 

Welcome to my practical python project! 
My name is Daniel, and through this project I am excited present to you a prject based on 
python fundamentals but also includes the full-stack of technologies from javascript in the forntened to 
python in the backend.

# Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap v4.3.2
4.Javascript
5.Fontawsome
6.Jquery library
8.Api
9.python
10.jinja 
11.flask
12.google fonts

# Features
This project feutrues a design that implements a simple catoon feel, with easy 
navigation. I intended for this to be a pick up and play game that allowed the 
user to play as long as they felt without time restrictions. But at the same 
time add a competative edge to the game in order to make it fun for everyone 
who plays.
## Features Left To Implement

The features which I would like to implement, is a three chance logic which 
enabled users to recieve a up to two hints per questions. This feature would 
utilize apis and javascript in order to interact with the the user and provide 
valuable hints to move the game forwards and allow them to progress to the next 
level with tricky questions.


# UX

My goal with ux design was to make sure that my application was as user friendly 
and as easy to navigate as possible. I was aiming to create an interface that 
was easy on the eyes and added to the vibe and feel of a classic arcade style 
game; through the use of font styles and color themes.

Through this project I strived to demonstrate the basics of user friendly 
interface by adding interaction where people expect it,ie. an input form greets 
the user as they sign in with their name. Once signed in they can get comfortable 
with their first question and progress through levels with different difficulty 
of questions. They questions are automatically displayed once; if they are 
correct on the first attempt you recieve your scor and move to the next level
if not you are automatically 

# Testing
Some of the trials I encountered while testing and updating, were ranging from
the very basic to difficult. During the testing phase I found it really strait 
forwards , in terms of approach of how I would create the game. With a game page,
flask framework and a leadership board. But my difficulities lie with creating,
the actual api calls from the front end through javascript in order to access
apis database files in the backened.

These events include:
#### Algorithmn//Logic Used

1. Enter your username and click send!
2. Question and answers being saved in a txt file
3. Create a an api functions (fetch questions from the question file as a list)
4. Randomly select a question 
5. return  the question
6. 2nd api call send the question & the anser to this api (backened)
4. takes question fetched from the file to match answer
5. If he gets the answer you will increment his points
6. correct return true incorrect return false
6. Logic verification( save question in a variable)
7. save answers in a variable
8. Read question fiel as readlines
9. find the index of the question close the file
10.then read the anser file as readlinesfind the answers on the smae index
11.close the answer filecheck the answer file
12.check if the user answer is == to answer in the answer sheet
13.return true if ==
14.return false if !=
15.create and api to save the score
16.extract the username and score  save it, in a txt file
17.call with two parameters username and score in python
18.Leaderboard 
19.open file response.txtread file readlines save in variable
20.check lenvariable 
21.if not ==0 check if length is =<20
22.pick all of them iterate through list length
23.if divisible by 2 it equals the username if not divisible by two it equals the score
24.create a dictionary of each user name and score one at a time
25.Logic for show leaderboard
26.read the file of score seperate the score and user in seperate list
even number username and odd number is score

# Credits 
I would like to credit numerous cites for inspiration in ux design as I could 
not have done this with inspiration and at times a little persperation. Cites 
used for application inspiration <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/gundam743/50_riddles">here.</a> 
I would also like to credit the stackoverflow community for any methods and 
code snippets used, it was a really awesome resource to roll up my sleeves and 
learn on the website.

# Media 

Any media you see inside this web application was created by yours truly
a.k.a me. Fonts were borrowed from google fonts. Many challenges were faced 
during the creation of this application but I learned that there is almost always
a solotion for everything or a workaround. I overcame many of them through the 
help of my mentor Abhay Barthwal. 
## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the use of bootstrap components. As well as 
w3schools.com for when I got stuck. I also searched stackoverflow.com countless
times for more information to solve problems with my application when I was stuck 
on the harder portions. Although the project was very close to my vision I would add 
some future additions. Thank you for viewing this presentation of my HTML,
CSS, Bootstrap, javascript and python practical application to a real working 
project. I enjoyed making it and sharing it and hope to present more to you in 
the future.Until then that wraps up my skills as as a brand new full-stack web 
developer.
