("What gets wetter as it dries?\n What do you get when you cross an automobile with a household animal?\nWhat has a ring, but no finger?\nThree lives have I gentle enough to sooth the skin,light enough to caress the sky, hard enough to crack rocks\nThe one who makes it sells it,the one who buys it never uses it, the one who uses it never knows they use it. What is it?\nThe more you have of it the less you see. What is it?\n I am lighter then what I am made of, more of me is hidden then seen? What am I?\nWhen you have me, you feel like sharing me. But, if you do share me, you don't have me. What am I\nSay my name and I dsiapear? What am I?\n I am always hungry, I must always be fed the finger I touch will soon turn red?\nForward im heavy but backword im not.
