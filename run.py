What am I?\n I am always hungry, I must always be fed the finger I touch will soon turn red?\nForward im heavy but backword im not. What am I?\nI know a word of letters three, add two,and fewer there will be?\nWhen young I am sweet in the sun. When middle aged, I make you gay. When old I am valued more then ever.\nWhen set loose I fly away Never so cursed, as when I go astray. What am I?\nI drive men mad for love of me. Easliy beaten. Never free.\nI reach for the sky but clutch to the ground, Sometimes I leave but Iâ€™m always around. What am I?\nAlways in you , sometimes on you.
